# inov8vnerd-bootstrap-4-starter

## Requirements 

_To work with this starter pack you need:_

Koala less/sass compiler http://koala-app.com/

## How does it Work

Add your sass folder to Koala and the magic will happen in Sassy Way.
Check a new css folder is created in your main folder and it means your're ready to go.

## Notice

app.css is already added to the index.html. What you only need to do is start adding your custom scss/css code in custom.scss file
